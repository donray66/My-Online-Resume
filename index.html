      <p>DT's true passion is exemplifieb by the enjoyment level that he experiences from Problem-Solving in all experiences where Goodness is opposed.  However, getting "Understanding" is what DT enjoys more than any other activity!  Which is not only the foundational-aim that he has in everything that he does.  But getting Understanding also simultaneously facilitates both stress-relief and motivation to DT.  However, DT also enjoys exercise to simultaneously fuel his drive and his physical-perseverance muscle.</p>
