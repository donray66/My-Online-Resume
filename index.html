    <h1>Activities & Hobbies:</h1>
      <p>DT's true passion is exemplified by the enjoyment level he experiences from Problem-Solving in all experiences where Goodness is opposed.  However, getting "Understanding" is what DT enjoys more than any other activity!  Which is not only the foundational-aim that he has in everything he does.  But getting "Understanding" also simultaneously facilitates both stress-relief and unequalled motivation to DT.  However, DT also enjoys exercise to simultaneously fuel his drive and strengthen his perseverance-muscle.</p>
